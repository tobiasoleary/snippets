### Inline Styling

I want to **emphasis** to you how _happy_ I am with this discovery. I would like to thank `Automator.app` for providing a simple way for hacking together a solution and [Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com) for his insights into this problem and critic of my in-progress script. 

### Block Quote

I like this quote from Jackie Chan:

> Don't try to be like Jackie. 
> There is only one Jackie. 
> Study computers instead.

## Addition (From @ttscoff)

If you have a file called "rtfstyle.txt" at `$HOME/styles/rtfstyle.txt` it will be used to style the RTF output of the service. It should contain a MultiMarkdown style "XHTML Header:" line and a compressed, single-line CSS file inside of `<style>` tags. See the included example.
