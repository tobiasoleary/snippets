# Snippets


This repository contains snippets and bits of information that I might value in the future.

* `markdown-to-rtf` - An attempt to use Markdown in Mail. Thanks to Brett Terpstra for taking an interest, adding some styles and figuring out the encoding bug. I recommend you use the [cleaned up version].(http://brettterpstra.com/2013/03/08/new-in-the-markdown-service-tools-in-place-markdown-to-rtf/).
* `phantomjs` - Random code, for use with phantomjs
* `ruby` - Random code related to ruby.
* `drupal` - Random code related to drupal.
* `LICENSE.md` - An attempt to be a little bit legal. Basically use it how you like, don't blame me. If I've misunderstood some of the legal stuff, contact me.
