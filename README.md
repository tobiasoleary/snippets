# Snippets


This repository contains snippets and bits of information that I might value in the future.

* `ruby-snippets.md` - Does what it says.
* `markdown-to-rtf` - An attempt to use Markdown in Mail. Thanks to Brett Terpstra for taking an interest, adding some styles and figuring out the encoding bug. I recommend you use the [cleaned up version].(http://brettterpstra.com/2013/03/08/new-in-the-markdown-service-tools-in-place-markdown-to-rtf/).
* `LICENSE.md` - An attempt to be a little bit legal. Basically use it how you like, don't blame me. If I've misunderstood something legally contact me.
